# Tai-s-Simulated-SIEM-Tool
A simulation-based Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform, built for education, testing, and experimentation. Instead of connecting to live systems, it generates simulated security logs (Windows, firewall, IDS/IPS, and system logs) that feed into a detection pipeline.
